# Rapid HTML Builder

> Desktop app for building/prototyping HTML


## Install

Go to the [releases](https://github.com/NicolaOrritos/rhb/releases) page and download an installer suitable for your platform. I'm currently supporting Windows and Linux.  
Then simply run the "RHB-Setup_vX.Y.Z.exe" installer and follow the instructions.  
On Linux the [AppImage](https://appimage.org/) provided requires no installation.
